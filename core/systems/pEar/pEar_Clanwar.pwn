	DIALOG OVERVIEW:
	
	DIALOG_CLANWAR_MAIN
	DIALOG_CLANWAR_REQUEST_CONFIRM

	/clanwar edit - DIALOG_CLANWAR_MAIN (DIALOG_STYLE_TABLIST_HEADERS)
	- Opponent - If -1, show N/A
	- Members per team: default of CW_MIN_PLAYERS
	- Mode - Give default of -1, show N/A
	- Map - Give default of -1, show N/A - Only show the maps if mode is not -1
	- Weapons: Show new dialog which gives weapons. 
	- Official ClanWar or Trial - Give default of trial.

	DIALOG_CLANWAR_MODE (DIALOG_STYLE_LIST)
	- Team DeathMatch
	- A/D
	
	DIALOG_CLANWAR_MAP (DIALOG_STYLE_LIST)
	- Only show maps that work with the mode.

	DIALOG_CLANWAR_WEAPONS (DIALOG_STYLE_TABLIST_HEADERS)
	- Max 5 weapons, give option for both weapon and ammo. Set default ammo to 5000.

	COMMAND OVERVIEW:
	- /clanwar: Will return [USAGE]: /clanwar (accept, deny, edit, request, ready, invite, kick)
	- /clanwar edit: Will show the main dialog.
	- /clanwar request: Will send error if not all options for the clanwar edit function has been edited. Otherwise show confirm clanwar dialog.
	- /clanwar ready: Both clanwar leaders will have to do the command in order to start the clanwar. Will teleport both teams to respective positions and have a freeze timer of 30 seconds.
		Will have to add error checking, make sure both teams are actually ready with enough clan members online and enough members invited.
	- /clanwar accept: Only clan rank 1 & 2 can accept a clanwar. Will set the player that accepted as the clanwar leader which enables him to do clanwar invite and clanwar ready.
		Members will use the same command when they are being being invited by their clanleader. Error check that the clanwar is not already full.
	- /clanwar deny: -==- ^, will do the same, with the exception that it will cancel the whole clanwar.
	- /clanwar invite: The clanwar has to be accepted and only the clanwar leader of each team can use it. Show amount of members needed to start.
	- /clanwar kick: Only the clanwar leader can kick a member of their own team and only before he/she has done /clanwar ready.
	- /clanwar inviteall: Easier for the clanleader if he wants to invite all his clanmembers and its first to join.

	Useful PVars:
		CW_AtClanWar - if = 1, then he is at a clanwar.
		CW_Invited, give the ID of the clan leader
